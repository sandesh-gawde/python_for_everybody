#Open files with file handler

fhand = open("file_path","r/w/a")
r - read (default when not specified)
w - write (erases the content of the current file and writes)
a - append (appends to the existing file)

-> Reading file line by line
fhand = open(file_path)
for line in fhand:
  line = line.rstrip()      #an additional \n that gets added, is stripped by rstrip.

-> try and except to open file is good idea
